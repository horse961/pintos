Modified thread.h: Added 2 fields to thread struct
- A field for the list element of the sleeping thread list
- A int64_t field that represents the current time + sleep time: the thread must wake up after this time 
- Made the sleep_list accessible (extern)

Modified thread.c: Created a list for the sleeping threads
- Sleeping threads list declared
- List is initialized in thread_init() function

Modified timer.c: Re-implemented timer sleep function
- Check if ticks < 0
- Compute current time + wakeup time
- Disable interrupts to avoid 'conflicts' between processes sharing data
- Set the wakeup time
- Insert in sleep list
- Block thread
- Release interrupt

TODO: Modify timer_interrupt() function-
TODO: Implement compare function for insertion in list
