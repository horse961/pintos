Modified thread.h: Added 2 fields to thread struct
- A field for the list element of the sleeping thread list
- A int64_t field that represents the current time + sleep time: the thread must wake up after this time 
- Made the sleep_list accessible (extern)

Modified thread.c: Created a list for the sleeping threads
- Sleeping threads list declared
- List is initialized in thread_init() function

Modified timer.c: Re-implemented timer sleep function
- Check if ticks < 0
- Compute current time + wakeup time
- Disable interrupts to avoid 'conflicts' between processes sharing data
- Set the wakeup time
- Insert in sleep list
- Block thread
- Release interrupt

Modified timer.c: Re-implemented timer interrupt function
- Whenever we have an interrupt, we check if we have to wake a sleeping thread:
- We iterate over the previously created sleeping threads list
- Compare for every thread their wakeup time and the current ticks
- If ticks > wakeup time, we wake the thread and pop it from the list.
- Otherwise, we break out of the loop. The threads are inserted in an ordered way, if one thread does not have to wake up, all the other ones too.
